# WebGestureCapture
The frontend for capturing hand gesture data through a browser on a VR Headset.
See [GestureLogger](https://github.com/Saatvik-Lochan/GestureLogger) for more 
details.

This project is to be used in conjunction with:
 - Backend: [WebGestureCaptureBackend](https://github.com/Saatvik-Lochan/WebGestureCaptureBackend)
 - Application: [GestureLogger](https://github.com/Saatvik-Lochan/GestureLogger)

## Usage
You can use this service at https://gesturelogger.com to trial the software or
for use in the collection of small datasets. Though I recommend hosting 
this and the backend yourself for any more serious project.

## Installation
This frontend uses [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool. See
https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html for building and deployment options.
